Hi [Manager’s Name],

I found out on Friday that I will need to undergo cervical spine surgery, and this morning (Monday) the hospital confirmed that I should report on Thursday, October 2nd for the procedure.

Following the surgery, my doctors expect that I will be on medical leave for about 4–6 weeks. I will provide the official sick leave documentation once I receive it.

Could you please advise me on who I should hand over my current tasks to before Thursday? I want to make sure everything is properly covered.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Damian
